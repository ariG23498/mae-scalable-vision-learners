# Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners

A TensorFlow implementation of Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners [1]. Our implementation of the proposed method is 
available in [] notebook. It includes evaluation with linear probing as well. Our main objective is to present the core idea of the
proposed method in a minimal and readable manner.

We will update this repository with more details.
